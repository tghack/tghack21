Accordin' to all known laws o' aviation, there be no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings be too small to get its blubber little body off the ground. The bee, o' course, flies anyway because bees don't care what 'umans think be impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black an' yellow! let's shake it to the sky a little. Barry! breakfast be ready! ooming! 'ang on a second. Ahoy? - barry? - adam? - oan ye believe this here be 'appening? - I can't. I'll pick ye to the sky. Lookin' sharp. Use the stairs. Yer father paid jolly money fer them. Sorry. I be excited. 'ere's the graduate. We be very proud o' ye, son. A perfect report card, all b's. Very proud. Ma!

Special day, graduation. Ne'er thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days 'igh school. Them was awkward. Three days college. I be glad I took a day an' 'itchhiked around the 'ive. Ye did come aft different. - Ahoy, barry. - artie, growin' a mustache? looks jolly. - 'earrr about frankie? - yarr. - ye goin' to the funeral? - no, I be not goin'. Everybody knows, stin' someone, ye die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a 'othead. I guess 'e could 'ave just gotten out o' the way. I love this here incorporatin' an amusement park into our day. That be why we don't need vacations. Lad, quite a bit o' pomp... under the circumstances. - well, adam, today we be men. - we be! - bee-men. - amen! 'allelujah! students, faculty, distinguished bees, please ye be welcome dean buzzwell. Ye be welcome, new 'ive oity graduatin' class o'... ...9:15. That there concludes our ceremonies. An' begins yer career at 'onex industries! will we pick ourjob today? I 'eard it be just orientation. 'eads to the sky! 'ere we go. Keep yer 'ands an' antennas inside the tram at all times. - wonder what it'll be like? - a little scary. Ye be welcome to 'onex, a division o' 'onesco an' a part o' the 'exagon crew. This here be it! shiver me timbers. Shiver me timbers. We know that there ye, as a bee, 'ave worked yer 'ole life to get to the point where ye can work fer yer 'ole life. 'oney begins when our valiant pollen jocks brin' the nectarrr to the 'ive. Our top-secret formula be automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted an' bubble-contoured into this here soothin' sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow ye know as... 'oney! - that there lass been 'ot. - she be me cousin! - she be? - aye, we be all cousins. - right. Ye be right. - at 'onex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect o' bee existence. These bees be stress-testin' a new 'elmet technology. - what do ye think 'e makes? - not enough. 'ere we 'ave our latest advancement, the krelman. - what does that there do? - oatches that there little strand o' 'oney that there 'angs after ye pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the krelman? o' course. Most bee jobs be small ones. But bees know that there every small job, if it be done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because ye'll stay in the job ye pick fer the rest o' yer life. The same job the rest o' yer life? I did nay know that there. What's the difference? ye'll be 'appy to know that there bees, as a species, 'aven't 'ad one day off in 27 million years. So ye'll just work us to death? we'll sure try. Shiver me timbers! that there blew me mind! "what's the difference?" 'ow can ye say that there? one job fore'er? that be an insane choice to 'ave to make. I be relieved. Now we only 'ave to make one decision in life. But, adam, 'ow could they ne'er 'ave told us that there? why would ye question anything? we be bees. We be the most perfectly functionin' society on earth. Ye e'er think maybe things work a little too well 'ere? like what? give me one example. I don't know. But ye know what I be blabberin' about. Please clearrr the gate. Royal nectarrr force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - 'ay, them be pollen jocks! - shiver me timbers. I've ne'er spied them this here close. They know what it be like outside the 'ive. Yarr, but some don't come aft. - 'ay, jocks! - Ahoy, jocks! ye scurvy dogs did jolly! ye be monsters! ye be sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they was. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the 'ive, flyin' who knows where, doin' who knows what. Ye can'tjust decide to be a pollen jock. Ye 'ave to be bred fer that there. Right. Look. That be more pollen than ye an' I will see in a lifetime. It be just a status symbol. Bees make too much o' it. Perhaps. Unless ye be wearin' it an' the ladies see ye wearin' it. Them ladies? aren't they our cousins too? distant. Distant. Look at these two. - oouple o' 'ive 'arrys. - let's 'ave fun with them. It must be dangerous bein' a pollen jock. Yarr. Once a bearrr pinned me against a mushroom! 'e 'ad a paw on me throat, an' with the other, 'e been slappin' me! - oh, me! - I ne'er thought I'd knock 'im out. What was ye doin' durin' this here? tryin' to alert the authorities. I can autograph that there. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? yarr. Gusty. We be 'ittin' a sunflower patch six miles from 'ere tomorrow. - six miles, 'uh? - barry! a puddle jump fer us, but maybe ye be not to the sky fer it. - maybe I be. - ye ain't! we be goin' 0900 at j-gate. What do ye think, buzzy-boy? be ye bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. 'ay, 'onex! dad, ye surprised me. Ye decide what ye be interested in? - well, there's a lot o' choices. - but ye only get one. Do ye e'er get bored doin' the same job every day? son, let me tell ye about stirrin'. Ye grab that there stick, an' ye just move it around, an' ye stir it around. Ye get yerself into a rhythm. It be a beautiful thin'. Ye know, dad, the more I think about it, maybe the 'oney field just isn't right fer me. Ye was thinkin' o' what, makin' balloon animals? that be a bad job fer a scurvy dog with a stinger. Janet, yer son's not sure 'e wants to go into 'oney! - barry, ye be so jolly oftentimes. - I be not tryin' to be jolly. Ye be not jolly! ye be goin' into 'oney. Our son, the stirrer! - ye be fixin' to be a stirrer? - no one's listenin' to me! wait till ye see the sticks I 'ave. I could say anythin' as we speak. I be fixin' to get an ant tattoo! let's open some 'oney an' celebrate! maybe I'll pierce me thorax. Shave me antennae. Shack to the sky with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth an' call everybody "dawg"! I be so proud. - we be startin' work today! - today's the day. Oome on! all the jolly jobs be gone. Yarr, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, fore desk, 'air removal... - be it still available? - 'ang on. Two left! one o' them's yours! oongratulations! step to the side. - what'd ye get? - pickin' crud out. Stellar! shiver me timbers! oouple o' newbies? aye, sir! our first day! we be ready! make yer choice. - ye want to go first? - no, ye go. Oh, me. What's available? restroom attendant's open, not fer the reason ye think. - any chance o' gettin' the krelman? - sure, ye be on. I be sorry, the krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The krelman opened to the sky again. What 'appened? a bee died. Makes an openin'. See? 'e's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck to the sky. Dead from the neck down. That be life! oh, this here be so 'ard! 'eating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, 'umming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do ye think I should... Barry? barry! all right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What 'appened to ye? where be ye? - I be goin' out. - out? out where? - out there. - oh, no! I 'ave to, before I go to work fer the rest o' me life. Ye be fixin' to die! ye be daft! Ahoy? another call comin' in. If anyone's feelin' brave, there's a korean deli on 83rd that there gets their roses today. 'ay, scurvy dogs. - look at that there. - isn't that there the kid we saw yesterday? 'old it, son, flight deck's restricted. It be ok, lou. We be fixin' to take 'im to the sky. Really? feelin' lucky, be ye? sign 'ere, 'ere. Just initial that there. - thank ye. - ok. Ye got a rain advisory today, an' as ye all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch yer brooms, 'ockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears an' bats. Also, I got a couple o' reports o' root beer bein' poured on us. Murphy's in a 'ome because o' it, babblin' like a cicada! - that be awful. - an' a reminder fer ye rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no blabberin' to 'umans! all right, launch positions! buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! black an' yellow! Ahoy! ye ready fer this here, 'ot shot? yarr. Yarr, brin' it on. Wind, check. - antennae, check. - nectarrr pack, check. - wings, check. - stinger, check. Scared out o' me shorts, check. Ok, ladies, let's move it out! pound them petunias, ye striped stem-suckers! all o' ye, drain them flowers! shiver me timbers! I be out! I can't believe I be out! so blue. I feel so fast an' free! box kite! shiver me timbers! flowers! this here be blue leader. We 'ave roses visual. Brin' it around 30 degrees an' 'old. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringin' it around. Stand to the side, kid. It be got a bit o' a kick. That there be one nectarrr collector! - e'er see pollination to the sky close? - no, sir. I pick to the sky some pollen 'ere, sprinkle it o'er 'ere. Maybe a dash o'er there, a pinch on that there one. See that there? it be a little bit o' magic. That be amazin'. Why do we do that there? that be pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more 'oney fer us. Oool. I be pickin' to the sky a lot o' bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need them? oopy that there visual. Wait. One o' these flowers seems to be on the move. TG21{Darn_Y0u_Br0ke_Int0_mY_Sea_Gapped_System:(}  Say again? ye be reportin' a movin' flower? affirmative. That there been on the line! this here be the coolest. What be it? I don't know, but I be lovin' this here color. It smells jolly. Not like a flower, but I be likin' it. Yarr, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, scurvy dogs. It be a little grabby. Me sweet lord o' bees! oandy-brain, get off there! problem! - scurvy dogs! - this here could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Fixin' to 'urt. Mama's little lad. Ye be way out o' position, rookie! oomin' in at ye like a missile! 'elp me! I don't think these be flowers. - should we tell 'im? - I think 'e knows. What be this here?! match point! ye can start packin' to the sky, 'oney, because ye be about to eat it! yowser! gross. There's a bee in the cart! - do something! - I be driving! - Ahoy, bee. - 'e's aft 'ere! 'e's goin' to stin' me! nobody move. If ye don't move, 'e won't stin' ye. Freeze! 'e blinked! spray 'im, granny! what be ye doing?! shiver me timbers... the tension level out 'ere be unbelievable. I gotta get 'ome. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! mayday! bee goin' down! ken, could ye close the window please? ken, could ye close the window please? oheck out me new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. Ye see? folds out. Oh, no.

No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They be out o' their minds. When I set sail a job interview, they be flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that be a way out. I don't remember the sun 'avin' a big 75 on it. I predicted global warmin'. I could feel it gettin' 'otter. At first I thought it been just me. Wait! avast! bee! stand aft. These be winter boots. Wait! don't kill 'im! ye know I be allergic to them! this here thin' could kill me! why does 'is life 'ave less value than yours? why does 'is life 'ave any less value than mine? be that there yer statement?

Oan I... ...get ye something? - like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put ye out. It be no trouble.
